#  STS - SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY

## Week 1

**Science**
**system** of **observation** and **experiments** used to gain **knowledge** about how the universe works.

**Technology**

**SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY**
Interactions between **science and technology and social, cultural, political, and economic contexts** that shape and are shaped by them.

## Week 2

**Scientific Method**
mathematical and experimental technique employed in the sciences ``the technique used in the construction and testing of a scientific hypothesis``

**Research**
An inquiry process that has clearly defined parameters and aims the discovery or creation of knowledge

**Characteristic of scientific methods**
* orderly and systematic process
* control external factors that are not under direct investigation
* findings are based on empirical evidences
*  findings can be **generalized**
* based on **assumptions or hypothesis**
* conducted to **develop or test hypothesis**

**Scientific Method**
* State of the Problem. **Observe**, **Question**
* Formulate a Hypothesis.
* Test Hypothesis **Experiment**
* Gather Data **Qualitative**, **Quantitative**
* Analyze and Interpret Data **Results**, **Conclusion**
* Draw Conclusions **Conclusion**
* Communicate Results **Report**

		The scientific method and research cycle only leads to progressively better understanding of a topic, but never a perfect understanding
